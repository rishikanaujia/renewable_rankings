## 🎓 Why Each Update is Necessary

### Core Value (Agents 1-8)
**Necessity**: ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

These agents:
- Use readily available data (World Bank)
- Cover core metrics (GDP, energy, financing)
- Provide 80% of system value
- Are needed for meaningful rankings

**Without these**: System incomplete, rankings unreliable

### Enhanced Coverage (Agents 9-14)
**Necessity**: ⭐⭐ IMPORTANT

These agents:
- Add policy and resource dimensions
- Require custom data collection
- Provide comprehensive coverage
- Differentiate countries better

**Without these**: Limited policy insights, gaps in assessment

### Advanced Features (Agents 15-18)
**Necessity**: ⭐ NICE-TO-HAVE

These agents:
- Add competitive analysis
- Require market intelligence
- Provide specialized insights
- Complete the framework

**Without these**: Core functionality intact, some depth missing
