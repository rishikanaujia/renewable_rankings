  "overview": "India's ambition in renewable energy, particularly in solar PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind, is a cornerstone for its energy transition and commitment to sustainable development. This ambition is crucial for attracting renewable energy investments, as it signals the government's long-term commitment to the sector. As of Q4 2024, India has set significant targets to increase its renewable energy capacity, aiming to reduce its carbon footprint and enhance energy security.",
  "current_status": "As of the latest data, India has set a target to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with specific emphasis on solar PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind energy. This target is among the world's most ambitious, reflecting India's commitment to leading in renewable energy transition. Recent developments include substantial investments in solar and wind projects, and the introduction of policies to support domestic manufacturing in the renewable energy sector.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 5 years, India's renewable energy capacity has seen a significant uptrend, with an annual growth rate of approximately 15%. Key policy changes, such as the launch of the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and the National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy, have accelerated this growth. This period also saw the initiation of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) by India, emphasizing its leadership role in global renewable energy.",
  "policy_framework": "India's renewable energy policy framework includes the National Solar Mission, the Wind Power Program, and the Offshore Wind Policy. The government has announced specific numbers, aiming for 100 GW solar, 60 GW onshore wind, and 5 GW offshore wind by 2030. Recent policy announcements include incentives for solar manufacturing and the introduction of renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) for large power consumers.",
