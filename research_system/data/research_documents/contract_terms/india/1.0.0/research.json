  "overview": "The contract terms for renewable energy projects in India, focusing on bankability, risk allocation, and PPA robustness, are crucial for attracting investment. These terms determine the feasibility and attractiveness of renewable energy projects to both domestic and international investors. As of the last available data in 2023, India has been working towards improving these aspects to bolster its renewable energy sector.",
  "current_status": "India's renewable energy sector has seen significant growth, with ambitious targets set by the government. However, challenges in contract terms, including PPA enforceability and risk allocation, have been noted. Efforts to standardize PPAs and enhance legal frameworks have been ongoing, aiming to improve the bankability of renewable energy projects.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, India has made strides in improving the regulatory and policy framework governing renewable energy contracts. Notable policy changes and government initiatives have aimed at addressing investor concerns, leading to a gradual improvement in the investment climate.",
  "policy_framework": "The government of India has implemented several policies aimed at promoting renewable energy, including the National Solar Mission and the Wind Energy Program. These policies, along with specific targets for renewable energy capacity, have been instrumental in shaping the contract terms and investment landscape.",
