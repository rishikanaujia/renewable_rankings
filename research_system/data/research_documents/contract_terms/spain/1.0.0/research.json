  "overview": "Spain's renewable energy sector has seen significant growth, driven by favorable government policies and a strong legal framework supporting contract terms for renewable energy projects. Contract terms, including bankability, risk allocation, and PPA robustness, are crucial for attracting investment. As of Q4 2024, Spain has continued to refine its approach, making its renewable energy contracts more investor-friendly.",
  "current_status": "Spain's renewable energy contracts as of Q4 2024 offer strong standardization and favorable risk allocation, making them highly bankable. The country has worked to address previous legal uncertainties, and recent reforms have further strengthened the enforceability of PPAs. Compared to regional averages, Spain's renewable energy contracts are considered more attractive to investors, with fewer risks and higher potential returns.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Spain has made significant strides in improving the terms of renewable energy contracts. Key turning points include legislative reforms in 2021 and 2023 that enhanced contract standardization and risk mitigation measures. These changes have contributed to a steady increase in renewable energy investment, with solar and wind projects experiencing the highest growth rates.",
  "policy_framework": "Spain's renewable energy policy framework is underpinned by the 2021 Climate Change and Energy Transition Act, which sets ambitious targets for renewable energy generation. Recent policy announcements have focused on streamlining regulatory processes and providing clearer guidelines for PPA enforcement. The government has committed to achieving 70% renewable energy in its electricity mix by 2030.",
