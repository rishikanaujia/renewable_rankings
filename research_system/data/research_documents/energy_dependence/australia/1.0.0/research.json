  "overview": "Energy dependence in Australia has traditionally been characterized by a significant reliance on domestic resources, including coal, natural gas, and increasingly, renewable energy sources. This parameter is crucial for renewable energy investment as it indicates the market potential for domestic energy production and the level of vulnerability to international energy price fluctuations. As of the last available data up to 2023, Australia has been working towards reducing its energy dependence through the development of renewable energy sources, aiming to enhance energy security and meet its climate targets.",
  "current_status": "As of the latest data, Australia's energy mix is undergoing a significant transformation, with renewable energy sources playing an increasingly important role. The country has vast solar and wind resources, and investments in these technologies have been growing. However, Australia also continues to export a large portion of its fossil fuel resources, particularly coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The exact figures for Q4 2024 cannot be provided, but trends up to 2023 indicate a gradual decrease in energy imports as domestic production of renewable energy increases.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Australia has seen a notable shift towards renewable energy, driven by technological advancements, policy support, and growing environmental awareness. This shift is reflected in the decreasing trend of energy imports as a percentage of total energy use. Key policy changes, such as the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and various state-level initiatives, have supported this transition.",
  "policy_framework": "The Australian government has implemented several policies aimed at reducing energy dependence and promoting renewable energy. These include the RET, which encourages the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources, and investment in energy storage and transmission infrastructure to support a more distributed energy generation model. Recent policy announcements have focused on accelerating the transition to renewables, though specific targets and numbers as of Q4 2024 would need to be verified against the latest sources.",
