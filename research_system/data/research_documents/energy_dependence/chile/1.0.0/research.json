  "overview": "Chile's energy sector has been characterized by a significant transformation towards renewable energy sources, aiming to reduce its dependence on energy imports. Energy dependence is a critical parameter for understanding a country's energy security and its ability to sustain and grow its economy without excessive reliance on external energy sources. For renewable energy investment, lower energy dependence not only signifies a robust domestic energy market but also indicates potential for growth in renewable energy infrastructure.",
  "current_status": "As of Q4 2024, Chile has made considerable progress in reducing its energy dependence through investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The country's geographical diversity offers substantial potential for various forms of renewable energy. Specific values indicating the percentage of energy imports would be essential to accurately score Chile's energy dependence according to the provided rubric.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Chile has seen a steady decrease in energy imports thanks to government policies promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. Key turning points include the implementation of the Renewable Energy Law and significant investments in renewable energy projects.",
  "policy_framework": "Chile's government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming for a certain percentage of its energy mix to come from renewable sources by a specific date. Recent policy announcements have focused on further reducing barriers to renewable energy investments and increasing the efficiency of energy use across the economy.",
