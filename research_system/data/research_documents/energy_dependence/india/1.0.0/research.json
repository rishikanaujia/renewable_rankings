  "overview": "India has been significantly reliant on energy imports, particularly in oil and coal, to meet its growing energy demands. This dependence on foreign energy sources poses challenges for energy security and affects the country's trade balance. However, India's focus on renewable energy development, including solar and wind, is a strategic move to reduce this dependence and transition towards a more sustainable energy mix.",
  "current_status": "As of Q4 2024, India's energy import dependency remains substantial, though efforts to increase domestic production of renewable energy have begun to show promise. The country's energy mix is evolving, with renewable energy sources accounting for an increasing share of the total energy consumption. Recent developments, such as the expansion of solar energy parks and wind farms, have contributed to a slight decrease in import dependency.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, India has seen a steady increase in renewable energy capacity, with significant year-on-year growth. Key policy changes, including the National Solar Mission and the wind energy auctions, have accelerated the adoption of renewable technologies. Despite these efforts, the overall energy dependence has decreased marginally due to the rising total energy demand.",
  "policy_framework": "The Indian government has implemented several policies aimed at reducing energy dependence and promoting renewable energy. These include the National Solar Mission, with a target to reach 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022, and the National Wind Energy Mission. Recent policy announcements have focused on increasing investments in renewable energy infrastructure and providing incentives for domestic production.",

Additionally, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires significant advancements in energy storage and grid management technologies.",
  "opportunities": "India's vast renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind, presents a significant opportunity for reducing energy imports. Supportive government policies and a growing market for renewable energy investments offer a favorable environment for the development of domestic energy resources.",
  "future_outlook": "Looking ahead to the next 2-5 years, India is expected to continue its focus on expanding renewable energy capacity, which will gradually reduce its energy import dependency. Policy measures aimed at encouraging domestic production and technological advancements in storage solutions will be critical to achieving energy independence.",
