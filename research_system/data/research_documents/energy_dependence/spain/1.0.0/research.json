  "overview": "Spain has traditionally been highly dependent on energy imports due to its limited domestic fossil fuel resources. This dependence has driven significant investment in renewable energy sources, aiming to reduce import reliance and improve energy security. Renewable energy investment is critical for Spain, not only for energy security but also for meeting its ambitious climate targets and transitioning to a more sustainable energy system.",
  "current_status": "As of the last available data, Spain's energy dependence was characterized by a significant reliance on imports for oil and gas, while it has made substantial progress in developing domestic renewable energy sources, particularly in solar and wind energy. The country has seen a notable increase in renewable energy capacity, contributing to a gradual decrease in energy import dependency.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Spain has accelerated its transition towards renewable energy, marked by significant investments in wind and solar projects. This shift has been supported by favorable policies and technological advancements, leading to increased renewable energy production and a slight decrease in energy import dependency.",
  "policy_framework": "Spain's energy policy framework includes the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), targeting a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a substantial increase in renewable energy's share in the energy mix. The government has also implemented various incentives and regulatory measures to promote renewable energy investments.",
