  "overview": "The expected return on renewable energy investments in China is a critical parameter for investors, reflecting the profitability and attractiveness of engaging in this sector. Given China's commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2060, the renewable energy sector is poised for significant growth, influenced by supportive government policies, technological advancements, and increasing market demand. The internal rate of return (IRR) is a key metric for assessing the viability and success of these investments.",
  "current_status": "As of the last available data, China's renewable energy sector has seen a substantial increase in investments, driven by declining costs of technology and strong government incentives. However, specific IRR values for Q4 2024 cannot be provided without real-time data. Historically, renewable energy projects in China have offered competitive IRRs compared to traditional energy sources, with solar and wind projects particularly standing out.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the IRR for renewable energy projects in China has seen variability due to factors such as policy changes, technological advancements, and market dynamics. Government policies promoting renewable energy have been pivotal in improving the financial attractiveness of these investments.",
  "policy_framework": "China's renewable energy policy framework includes various laws, regulations, and targets aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting green energy. These policies have been instrumental in creating a favorable environment for renewable energy investments, offering incentives and subsidies to enhance their profitability.",
