  "overview": "India's renewable energy sector has been a focal point for both domestic and international investors due to its robust growth, supported by favorable government policies and a global shift towards sustainable energy sources. Expected Return, measured by the Projected Internal Rate of Return (IRR), is a critical parameter for evaluating the attractiveness of renewable energy investments. High IRR values indicate not only the profitability but also the potential impact of these investments on accelerating India's transition to a low-carbon economy.",
  "current_status": "As of Q4 2024, the renewable energy sector in India is experiencing a dynamic shift, with solar and wind energy projects leading the charge. The IRR for these projects has seen a significant improvement, thanks to technological advancements, economies of scale, and competitive bidding processes. Recent developments, such as the introduction of green bonds and favorable adjustments in tariff policies, have further enhanced the investment appeal.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the IRR for renewable energy projects in India has shown an upward trajectory. This can be attributed to a combination of factors including government incentives, improved financing conditions, and a decrease in the cost of renewable technologies, especially solar PV panels and wind turbines.",
  "policy_framework": "The Indian government has implemented several policies aimed at boosting renewable energy investment. These include the National Solar Mission, Wind Energy Program, and incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies for renewable energy projects. The government's commitment to achieving 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 has been a significant driver.",
