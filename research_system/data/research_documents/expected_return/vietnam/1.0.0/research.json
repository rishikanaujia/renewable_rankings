  "overview": "The expected return on renewable energy investments in Vietnam has become a crucial parameter for investors due to the country's commitment to expanding its renewable energy capacity. This parameter is significant as it helps investors evaluate the profitability and risk associated with renewable energy projects in Vietnam. As of Q4 2024, the renewable energy sector in Vietnam has seen substantial growth, driven by government policies favoring green energy and international investment.",
  "current_status": "As of the last quarter of 2024, Vietnam's renewable energy sector is characterized by a promising increase in internal rate of return (IRR) for renewable projects, particularly in solar and wind energy. Recent developments, such as improvements in technology and increased government support, have made renewable energy projects more viable and attractive to investors.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the IRR for renewable energy projects in Vietnam has seen a steady increase. This can be attributed to several factors, including a decrease in the cost of renewable technology and an increase in efficiency. Key policy changes have also played a significant role in this upward trend.",
  "policy_framework": "The Vietnamese government has implemented several policies aimed at promoting renewable energy, including feed-in tariffs (FITs) and tax incentives for renewable energy projects. These policies have been crucial in increasing the profitability of renewable energy investments in the country.",

  "opportunities": "The ongoing global shift towards renewable energy, coupled with Vietnam's strategic position and government support, presents significant opportunities for growth in the renewable energy sector. The increasing demand for clean energy both domestically and internationally can drive further investments.",
  "future_outlook": "The future outlook for renewable energy investments in Vietnam is positive, with expected policy changes aimed at further supporting the sector.
