  "overview": "Ownership consolidation in Vietnam's renewable energy sector is a critical parameter for understanding market dynamics and investment opportunities. This parameter indicates the level of market concentration and the diversity of ownership among renewable energy assets. A lower consolidation score suggests a more competitive market with diverse ownership, which can encourage innovation and investment. As of the last available data, Vietnam's renewable energy market has been experiencing gradual consolidation, with a significant number of projects being developed by a mix of domestic and international investors.",
  "current_status": "As of the latest data, the renewable energy market in Vietnam has seen an increase in foreign and domestic investment, leading to a moderately consolidated market. Key numerical metrics and recent developments indicate a shift towards more diverse ownership, although the top three owners still hold a significant market share. Comparison to regional averages suggests that Vietnam's market is moderately consolidated relative to its ASEAN peers.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Vietnam's renewable energy sector has evolved from a highly fragmented market to a more consolidated structure. This change has been driven by policy reforms, increased investment, and the entry of large-scale international players. The growth rates and patterns indicate a steady increase in consolidation, with significant investments in solar and wind energy projects.",
  "policy_framework": "Vietnam's government has implemented several laws, regulations, and policies to promote renewable energy, including feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and investment subsidies. The government's commitment to increasing the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix has been a key driver of market consolidation. Recent policy announcements aim to further support the sector's growth and attract more diverse ownership.",
