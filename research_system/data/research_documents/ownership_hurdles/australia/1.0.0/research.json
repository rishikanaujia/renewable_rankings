  "overview": "Australia has historically been open to foreign investment, including in the renewable energy sector. Ownership hurdles are an important parameter for renewable energy investment as they dictate the level of access and control foreign entities can have in the domestic market. As of the last available data, Australia's regulatory environment is designed to encourage foreign investment while protecting national interests, with specific scrutiny applied to investments in sensitive sectors.",
  "current_status": "As of the last update, Australia allows significant levels of foreign ownership in renewable energy projects, subject to approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). The FIRB assesses proposals on a case-by-case basis, focusing on national interest implications. Recent developments have seen a tightening in scrutiny over foreign investments in critical infrastructure, which could include certain large-scale renewable energy projects.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Australia has maintained a relatively open stance towards foreign investment in renewable energy. However, there has been a gradual shift towards more stringent review processes, reflecting global trends towards securing critical infrastructure. This includes the introduction of new legislation aimed at giving the government greater oversight over foreign investments in sensitive sectors.",
  "policy_framework": "The key legal framework governing foreign investment in Australia includes the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, and the guidelines issued by the FIRB. Recent policy announcements have emphasized the importance of renewable energy for Australia's economic future, suggesting a continued welcome for foreign investment in this sector, albeit with increased regulatory oversight.",

However, the overall policy environment is likely to remain supportive of foreign investment in renewable energy, given the sector's importance to Australia's economic and environmental objectives.",
