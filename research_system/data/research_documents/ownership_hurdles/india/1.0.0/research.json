Foreign ownership is limited to 25-40% in most cases, with complex approval processes and regulatory barriers hindering greater international investment. The OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index ranks India relatively high in terms of barriers to foreign ownership compared to other countries. Recent developments have seen some easing of restrictions in certain sub-sectors, but overall, India still presents high barriers to foreign ownership in the renewable energy market.\"\n\n  \"historical_trends\": \"Over the past few years, India has gradually increased foreign ownership limits in the renewable energy sector, aiming to attract more international investment. Key turning points include policy changes that allowed higher levels of foreign ownership in specific sub-sectors. Growth rates in foreign investment have been positive but constrained by regulatory hurdles. The trend has been towards a gradual opening up of the market, but significant barriers still exist as of Q4 2024.\"\n\n  \"policy_framework\": \"India's policy framework includes various laws, regulations, and policies that govern foreign ownership in the renewable energy sector. The government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity addition, with a goal of reaching 450 GW by 2030.
