  "overview": "Brazil is recognized for its significant potential in renewable energy resources, particularly in solar and wind energy. The country's vast land area, coupled with high solar irradiation and favorable wind conditions, especially in the northeast region, makes it an attractive location for renewable energy investments. Resource availability is a critical parameter for assessing the viability and potential return on investment in the renewable energy sector. As of the latest data, Brazil's commitment to expanding its renewable energy capacity is evident in its policy framework and ongoing projects.",
  "current_status": "As of the last available data, Brazil has shown substantial growth in both solar and wind energy sectors. The country benefits from high solar irradiation levels, with average values exceeding 5 kWh/m\u00b2/day in many regions, making it an excellent candidate for solar power projects. Wind resources are also significant, particularly in the northeastern region, where wind speeds can average over 8.5 m/s at 100m hub height. Recent developments include the commissioning of new solar and wind farms, contributing to Brazil's renewable energy mix.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Brazil has seen a notable increase in renewable energy capacity, driven by favorable government policies, technological advancements, and decreasing costs of solar and wind technologies. The growth rates for installed solar and wind capacity have been impressive, reflecting the country's commitment to diversifying its energy portfolio.",
  "policy_framework": "Brazil's government has implemented several policies and regulations to support the development of renewable energy, including tax incentives, auctions for renewable energy projects, and financing support from national development banks. Specific targets for renewable energy capacity have been set, aiming to significantly increase the share of renewables in Brazil's energy mix by 2030.",
