  "overview": "Spain is renowned for its abundant solar and wind resources, making it an attractive location for renewable energy investments. The country's geographical position offers high solar irradiation and favorable wind speeds, particularly in regions such as Andalusia for solar and Galicia for wind. This parameter is crucial for investors as it directly impacts the efficiency and return on investment of renewable energy projects.",
  "current_status": "As of the last available data, Spain has one of Europe's highest solar irradiations and consistent wind profiles. The country has been expanding its solar and wind energy capacity, with significant installations of photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind farms. Recent developments include the commissioning of new large-scale renewable projects and the government's support for green energy.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Spain has seen a substantial increase in its renewable energy capacity, driven by technological advancements and supportive policies. The growth rates for solar and wind energy installations have been among the highest in Europe, reflecting Spain's commitment to transitioning towards a more sustainable energy system.",
  "policy_framework": "Spain's government has implemented various laws and regulations to promote renewable energy, including financial incentives, tax benefits, and streamlined permitting processes. The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) outlines ambitious targets for renewable energy generation by 2030.",
