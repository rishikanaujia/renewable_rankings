  "overview": "The United Kingdom has been actively developing its renewable energy sector, with a particular focus on wind and solar energy. Given the country's geographical location, it benefits from significant wind resources, especially offshore, which is among the best in the world. Solar energy potential is less compared to sunnier countries but is still viable, especially in the southern regions. Resource availability is crucial for renewable energy investment as it directly impacts the feasibility and potential return on investment of renewable energy projects.",
  "current_status": "As of the last data available in 2023, the United Kingdom has made substantial investments in both wind and solar energy. The country has one of the largest offshore wind farms globally, and there has been a steady increase in solar installations, despite the UK's moderate solar irradiation levels. Wind speeds in the UK are favorable for wind energy production, particularly in Scotland and offshore locations. Solar irradiation is relatively lower compared to Southern Europe but sufficient for meaningful solar energy production, especially during the summer months.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, there has been a significant increase in the capacity and output of both wind and solar energy in the UK. Government policies have supported this growth, with various incentives for renewable energy projects. The offshore wind sector has seen particularly rapid expansion, with several large projects coming online.",
  "policy_framework": "The UK government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030. Policies such as the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme have been instrumental in supporting the development of renewable energy projects. The government has also committed to phasing out coal power and has provided substantial funding for renewable energy research and development.",
