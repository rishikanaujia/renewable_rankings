  "overview": "The United States has a diverse and abundant portfolio of renewable energy resources, making it a prime location for investment in solar and wind energy projects. The quality and abundance of these resources vary significantly across the country, with high solar irradiation in states like Arizona and California, and strong wind resources in the Great Plains. This parameter is crucial for renewable energy investment as it directly impacts the efficiency and return on investment of renewable energy projects.",
  "current_status": "As of Q4 2024, the United States continues to exhibit strong solar and wind resource availability. Solar irradiation averages range from 4.5 kWh/m\u00b2/day in northern regions to over 6.0 kWh/m\u00b2/day in southwestern states. Wind resources are particularly strong in the central United States, with average wind speeds exceeding 7.0 m/s at 80m hub height. Recent developments include the expansion of offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard, capitalizing on consistent wind speeds averaging 8.5 m/s. Compared to regional averages, the United States stands out for its high-quality wind resources, particularly in the Midwest and offshore areas.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 5 years, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of these resources, driven by technological advancements and decreasing costs of solar and wind technologies. Solar irradiation utilization has grown by 35%, with wind energy production increasing by 40% since 2019. Key turning points include the extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar projects and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind projects, stimulating growth in both sectors.",
  "policy_framework": "The United States federal government has implemented several policies to support the development of renewable energy, including tax incentives like the ITC and PTC, and regulatory support for renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in many states. The Biden administration's commitment to a carbon-neutral power sector by 2035 has further accelerated investments in renewable energy, with specific targets for the installation of 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030.",
