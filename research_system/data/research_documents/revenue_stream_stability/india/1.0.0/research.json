The average PPA term for solar projects is around 25 years, providing exceptional stability. Wind projects also have long-term PPAs ranging from 20 to 25 years, ensuring outstanding revenue security. Recent developments include the introduction of hybrid renewable energy projects that combine solar and wind to optimize revenue streams. India's revenue stream stability surpasses regional averages, with most projects having PPAs covering the full project life.\"\n\n  \"historical_trends\": \"Over the past 3-5 years, India has made significant progress in enhancing revenue stream stability for renewable energy projects. Key turning points include the implementation of competitive bidding processes for PPAs, which have led to lower tariffs and longer contract durations. The growth rate of PPA terms has been steady, with an average increase of 1-2 years every year. This trend indicates a positive trajectory towards greater revenue security and investor confidence in the sector.\"\n\n  \"policy_framework\": \"India's renewable energy policy framework includes the National Solar Mission and National Wind Mission, which aim to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, with a further target of 450 GW by 2030. The government has committed to promoting long-term PPAs to ensure revenue stability for investors.
