  "overview": "Australia's grid infrastructure is critical for the integration and reliability of renewable energy sources. The country has been focusing on upgrading its grid to accommodate the growing share of renewables in its energy mix. The quality of grid infrastructure, transmission capacity, and reliability are essential for reducing curtailment risk and enabling greater deployment of renewable energy technologies.",
  "current_status": "As of the last available data, Australia has been making significant investments in its grid infrastructure to improve quality and transmission capacity. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has been actively working on enhancing grid reliability to support the country's renewable energy goals. However, challenges such as grid congestion and the need for further investment in transmission infrastructure have been identified.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Australia has seen a substantial increase in renewable energy capacity, necessitating upgrades and expansions to its grid infrastructure. Key policy changes and investments have been aimed at addressing these needs, with a focus on reducing congestion and improving grid stability.",
  "policy_framework": "The Australian government and regulatory bodies have implemented several policies and regulations to support grid enhancements and renewable energy integration. These include the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and various state-level initiatives designed to encourage renewable energy investment and grid upgrades.",
