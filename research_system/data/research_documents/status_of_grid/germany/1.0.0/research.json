  "overview": "Germany has been at the forefront of integrating renewable energy into its grid, driven by its Energiewende (energy transition) policy. The quality of grid infrastructure, transmission capacity, and reliability are crucial for the continued expansion of renewable energy. High grid quality reduces the risk of curtailment and ensures that generated renewable energy can be effectively distributed and utilized.",
  "current_status": "As of the last data in 2023, Germany's grid infrastructure was undergoing significant upgrades to accommodate the increasing share of renewables, particularly wind and solar energy. The country has been working on enhancing its transmission capacity to reduce bottlenecks, especially between the northern wind-rich regions and the southern consumption-heavy regions. Recent developments include the commissioning of new high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines. However, challenges such as public opposition and regulatory hurdles have caused delays in grid expansion projects.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 5 years, Germany has made considerable progress in improving its grid infrastructure. This includes investments in both transmission and distribution networks to enhance reliability and capacity. The government and grid operators have focused on digitalization and smart grid technologies to better manage the variability of renewable energy sources.",
  "policy_framework": "Germany's Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) oversees the regulatory framework for the grid. Key policies supporting grid enhancement include the Electricity Market Act and the Grid Expansion Acceleration Act. The government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming for 65% of electricity consumption to be covered by renewables by 2030, necessitating substantial grid upgrades.",
