  "overview": "The United Kingdom's grid infrastructure is crucial for integrating renewable energy sources and achieving its carbon neutrality goals. High-quality grid infrastructure facilitates the deployment of renewables by ensuring efficient energy transmission and reducing the risk of energy curtailment. As of the last available data, the UK has been investing in upgrading its grid to accommodate the increasing share of renewable energy, focusing on enhancing grid reliability, transmission capacity, and modernizing its infrastructure.",
  "current_status": "As of the latest data, the UK's grid infrastructure has seen significant improvements, with investments in smart grid technologies, increased transmission capacity, and efforts to reduce congestion. The country has been working towards integrating a higher proportion of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, into its energy mix. These efforts are reflected in the reduced SAIDI/SAIFI metrics, indicating improved reliability and fewer outages.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the UK has made substantial progress in enhancing its grid infrastructure. Key turning points include the adoption of policies aimed at increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix and the initiation of projects to upgrade aging infrastructure. These efforts have resulted in a steady improvement in grid reliability and transmission capacity.",
  "policy_framework": "The UK government has implemented several policies and regulations to support grid upgrades and the integration of renewable energy. These include commitments to reduce carbon emissions, financial incentives for renewable energy projects, and regulations that facilitate energy storage and demand response technologies. Recent policy announcements have further solidified the government's commitment to a sustainable and resilient energy future.",
