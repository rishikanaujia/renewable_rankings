  "overview": "As of the latest available data, India has been aggressively promoting renewable energy through a variety of support schemes, recognizing its critical role in meeting the country's energy demands, reducing carbon emissions, and achieving sustainable development goals. Support schemes such as auctions for solar and wind capacity, viability gap funding, and solar park schemes have been instrumental. These mechanisms matter for renewable energy investment as they provide financial incentives and regulatory certainty, making renewable energy projects more viable and attractive to investors.",
  "current_status": "India has implemented several key support schemes, including competitive bidding for wind and solar projects, capital subsidy schemes for small solar projects, and incentives for rooftop solar installations. The country has also introduced policies to promote domestic manufacturing of solar PV cells and modules, including production-linked incentives. Recent developments include the expansion of the PM-KUSUM scheme, aimed at supporting the installation of solar pumps and grid-connected solar power plants among farmers.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, India has seen a significant shift from feed-in tariffs (FiT) to competitive bidding processes for allocating renewable energy projects. This transition has led to a substantial reduction in tariffs and has attracted significant private sector investment. The country has also seen an expansion in the scope of its renewable energy policies to include storage solutions and hybrid projects.",
  "policy_framework": "The Indian government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity, aiming for 450 GW by 2030. Key policies supporting these targets include the National Solar Mission, the National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy, and the Green Energy Corridor Project for enhancing transmission infrastructure. The government has also announced plans to implement a basic customs duty on solar cells and modules to encourage domestic manufacturing.",

  "challenges": "Despite significant progress, India faces challenges such as land acquisition difficulties, financial health of discoms affecting power purchase agreements, and grid integration of renewable energy. Regulatory hurdles and delays in implementing policy changes also pose risks to the growth of renewable energy.",
  "opportunities": "India's large landmass and high solar insolation present significant opportunities for solar energy. The growing demand for electricity and the government's focus on green energy are driving investments in renewable energy. Technological advancements and decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies also offer potential for growth.",
  "future_outlook": "The future outlook for renewable energy in India is positive, with expectations of continued growth in capacity and investments. Policy support and technological advancements are expected to further reduce costs and improve efficiency, making renewable energy increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources.",
