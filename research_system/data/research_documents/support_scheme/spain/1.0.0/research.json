  "overview": "As of the last update in 2023, Spain has been recognized for its commitment to renewable energy, underpinned by a comprehensive support scheme that includes financial incentives, regulatory frameworks, and ambitious national targets. The importance of such support schemes lies in their ability to attract investment, drive technological innovation, and facilitate the transition towards a sustainable energy system. Spain's approach has historically emphasized solar and wind power, reflecting its geographical advantages.",
  "current_status": "Spain's renewable energy sector benefits from a multifaceted support scheme, comprising feed-in tariffs (FiTs), auctions for capacity allocation, tax incentives, and regulatory support for self-consumption. The country has successfully conducted several renewable energy auctions, resulting in competitive prices for solar and wind energy. The regulatory framework encourages both large-scale projects and smaller, community-based initiatives, aiming to balance the development across different regions and technologies.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Spain has seen a significant shift in its support scheme for renewable energy, moving from a FiT-based system to competitive auctions. This transition aimed to reduce the cost of renewable energy and increase efficiency in capacity allocation. The government has also introduced measures to support self-consumption and energy storage, recognizing their importance in a decentralized energy system.",
  "policy_framework": "Spain's renewable energy policy framework is anchored in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which sets ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity by 2030. Recent policy announcements have focused on streamlining administrative processes, improving grid infrastructure, and setting clear guidelines for the integration of renewable energy sources.",

  "challenges": "Despite the supportive policy environment, Spain faces challenges related to grid capacity and integration of intermittent renewable sources. Administrative hurdles and land use conflicts also pose risks to the rapid deployment of new projects.",
  "opportunities": "Spain's abundant solar and wind resources, combined with a supportive regulatory framework, present significant opportunities for growth in the renewable energy sector. The government's focus on green hydrogen and energy storage offers new avenues for investment and innovation.",
  "future_outlook": "Looking ahead to the next 2-5 years, Spain is expected to continue its trajectory towards increasing renewable energy capacity, with a focus on solar PV, wind, and green hydrogen. Policy adjustments and technological advancements will play a critical role in addressing current challenges and unlocking further growth potential.",
