  "overview": "As of Q4 2024, the United States continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to renewable energy through a variety of support schemes. These mechanisms are critical for reducing the cost of renewable energy technologies, encouraging investment, and achieving national climate goals. The current state of support in the U.S. reflects a mature market with a mix of federal incentives, state-level policies, and regulatory frameworks designed to promote the adoption and expansion of renewable energy sources.",
  "current_status": "The United States has implemented several key support mechanisms, including the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), which have been pivotal in the growth of solar and wind energy respectively. As of Q4 2024, the ITC offers a 26% tax credit for solar projects that begin construction by the end of 2023, with a step-down to 22% in 2024. The PTC provides a per-kilowatt-hour (kWh) tax credit for electricity generated by eligible renewable sources, which was extended through 2021 with a phase-down schedule for projects starting construction thereafter. Additionally, state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) mandate that a certain percentage of electricity must come from renewable sources, further driving the market.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the U.S. has seen significant fluctuations in its support for renewable energy. The extension and modification of the ITC and PTC have been critical turning points, providing much-needed certainty to investors and developers. The growth rates of solar and wind installations have varied, with solar experiencing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% and wind around 9% from 2019 to 2023.",
  "policy_framework": "The Biden administration's commitment to a clean energy future has reinforced the policy framework supporting renewable energy. The American Jobs Plan, proposed in 2021, aims to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in renewable energy and grid infrastructure. While specific commitments and targets are subject to legislative negotiation, the plan underscores the federal government's support for renewable energy as a pillar of its climate and economic policy.",

The potential extension or modification of key tax credits, along with investments in grid modernization and energy storage, could further accelerate the adoption of renewable energy.",

Continued technological advancements and cost reductions in renewable energy technologies, coupled with supportive federal and state policies, are likely to drive significant investment in the sector.",
