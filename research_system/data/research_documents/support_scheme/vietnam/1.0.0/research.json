  "overview": "Vietnam has been rapidly expanding its renewable energy sector, with a strong focus on solar and wind power. The support schemes for renewable energy in Vietnam have played a crucial role in attracting investment and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy technologies. These mechanisms are vital for investors as they provide financial incentives and regulatory certainty, reducing the risks associated with renewable energy projects.",
  "current_status": "As of the last update in 2023, Vietnam's renewable energy sector was supported by a mix of feed-in tariffs (FiTs), auctions, and direct power purchase agreements (PPAs). The FiT scheme, in particular, has been instrumental in the growth of solar energy, offering attractive prices for solar electricity fed into the national grid. However, the transition to auction-based schemes for large-scale projects is expected to introduce more competitive pricing and efficiency in the allocation of projects.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Vietnam has seen significant shifts in its support schemes for renewable energy. Initially, high FiTs led to a boom in solar power installations, particularly rooftop solar. However, concerns over grid capacity and the sustainability of high subsidy levels led to adjustments in FiT rates and a gradual shift towards competitive auctions.",
  "policy_framework": "The Vietnamese government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming to increase its share in the power mix. Key policies include the National Power Development Plan and various decrees specifying FiTs, tax incentives, and import duty exemptions for renewable energy equipment. The move towards auctions is also part of the policy framework, aiming to promote efficiency and transparency in the sector.",
