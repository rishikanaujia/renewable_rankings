  "overview": "Chile has been a leader in renewable energy investment in Latin America, thanks to its stable economy, favorable government policies, and rich natural resources for solar and wind energy. System modifiers such as currency risk, geopolitical factors, and market anomalies are crucial for assessing the investment climate. As of Q4 2024, understanding these factors is vital for investors considering the renewable energy sector in Chile.",
  "current_status": "As of the latest data, Chile exhibits a stable currency with minor fluctuations against major currencies. Geopolitical risks are low, with a stable government and policies favorable to foreign investment. Market anomalies are infrequent, thanks to a well-regulated financial system. Compared to regional averages, Chile stands out for its economic stability and investment-friendly environment.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Chile has seen a significant improvement in its system modifiers. Currency stability has been achieved through effective monetary policies, while geopolitical risks have been minimized through proactive governance and international diplomacy. Market anomalies have decreased due to enhanced regulatory frameworks.",
  "policy_framework": "Chile's government has implemented several laws and regulations to attract renewable energy investment, including tax incentives and streamlined permitting processes. The country has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, with specific targets for renewable energy capacity additions.",
