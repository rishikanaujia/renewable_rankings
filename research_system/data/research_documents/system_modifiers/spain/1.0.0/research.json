  "overview": "Spain's renewable energy sector has been significantly influenced by system modifiers such as currency risk, geopolitical factors, and market anomalies. These factors are crucial for investors as they impact the overall risk and return profile of renewable energy investments. As of Q4 2024, Spain has managed to maintain a relatively stable economic and geopolitical environment, fostering a conducive atmosphere for renewable energy investments.",
  "current_status": "As of the last quarter of 2024, Spain exhibits moderate currency volatility with the Euro remaining stable against major currencies. Geopolitical risks are low, thanks to Spain's stable political climate and strong EU membership. Market anomalies are occasionally observed but are swiftly managed through regulatory measures. Compared to regional averages, Spain stands out for its supportive policies towards renewable energy, making it an attractive market for investors.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Spain has seen a significant shift towards a more stable and favorable investment environment for renewable energy. Currency stability has improved, thanks to the European Central Bank's effective monetary policies. Geopolitical risks have been consistently low, with Spain maintaining strong international relations. Market anomalies have decreased due to enhanced regulatory oversight.",
  "policy_framework": "Spain's government has implemented several policies aimed at boosting renewable energy investments. These include tax incentives, subsidies for renewable energy projects, and streamlined permitting processes. The government has committed to achieving 50% renewable energy in its energy mix by 2030, underlining its support for the sector.",
