  "overview": "System modifiers in the context of renewable energy investment in the United States encompass composite adjustment factors such as currency risk, geopolitical factors, and market anomalies. These modifiers act as a final calibration layer for overall rankings, influencing the attractiveness of the investment environment. Understanding and assessing these system modifiers is crucial for investors to make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks associated with renewable energy projects.",
  "current_status": "As of Q4 2024, the United States exhibits a relatively stable currency with improving geopolitical conditions. Currency volatility is at a moderate level, and geopolitical uncertainties have decreased compared to previous years. Market anomalies are being closely monitored, but overall, the system modifiers present a below moderate positive impact on renewable energy investments. The country is in a favorable position with low risk factors compared to other regions.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the system modifiers in the United States have shown a trend towards increased stability. Currency volatility has decreased, geopolitical risks have been managed effectively, and market anomalies have been addressed. Key turning points include policy reforms and economic stability measures that have contributed to the current positive environment for renewable energy investments.",
  "policy_framework": "The United States has a robust policy framework supporting renewable energy investments, including federal incentives, tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards. The government has committed to achieving specific targets, such as increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to 20% by 2025. Recent policy announcements have focused on promoting clean energy technologies and reducing carbon emissions to combat climate change.",

The transition towards a low-carbon economy presents opportunities for investors to capitalize on the increasing demand for renewable energy solutions.",
  "future_outlook": "Looking ahead, the United States is expected to continue on a path of sustainable growth in renewable energy investments. Projections indicate a steady increase in renewable energy capacity over the next 2-5 years, driven by favorable policy changes and market dynamics. Investors can expect a stable and supportive environment for renewable energy projects, with opportunities for long-term returns.",
