  "overview": "Australia's renewable energy sector has demonstrated significant growth over the past decade, underpinned by robust policy frameworks, technological advancements, and increasing investment in solar, wind, and battery storage. The track record parameter is crucial for assessing Australia's market execution capabilities and regulatory environment, which are key indicators for investment risk and opportunity assessment in the renewable energy domain.",
  "current_status": "As of Q4 2024, Australia has continued to expand its renewable energy capacity, reaching a cumulative installed capacity of 70 GW. This growth is primarily driven by large-scale solar and wind projects, alongside significant contributions from rooftop solar installations. Recent developments include the completion of the Sunraysia Solar Farm and the expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme, which have contributed to Australia's energy transition goals.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, Australia's renewable energy capacity has seen an average annual growth rate of 10%, with solar and wind energy accounting for the majority of new installations. Key policy changes, such as the enhancement of the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and the introduction of state-level incentives, have accelerated this growth.",
  "policy_framework": "The Australian government has set a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030, supported by policies such as the RET and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). Recent policy announcements include increased funding for renewable energy technologies and grid infrastructure upgrades to accommodate higher renewable penetration.",
