  "overview": "India has been making significant strides in renewable energy deployment, aiming to establish itself as a global leader in this sector. The track record parameter is crucial for renewable energy investment as it reflects the country's commitment to transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. As of Q4 2024, India's cumulative installed capacity in renewable energy showcases its proven market execution and indicates reduced regulatory risk for investors.",
  "current_status": "As of the latest data available, India has significantly increased its renewable energy capacity, making it one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy. The country has successfully installed over 100 GW of renewable energy capacity, including solar, wind, biomass, and small hydroelectric projects. This achievement aligns with India's ambitious targets to reach 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. The rapid growth in installed capacity highlights India's commitment to enhancing its renewable energy infrastructure and reducing its carbon footprint.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, India's renewable energy capacity has seen exponential growth. Key policy changes and government initiatives have played a pivotal role in this expansion. The introduction of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the amendment of the Electricity Act to include renewable energy within its ambit have been significant. These initiatives have resulted in a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% in renewable energy capacity since 2019.",
  "policy_framework": "India's policy framework for renewable energy is anchored by the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which includes the National Solar Mission and the National Wind Energy Mission. The government has set specific targets under these missions to increase the share of renewable energy in India's energy mix. Recent policy announcements, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing, further support the country's renewable energy sector.",

Regulatory hurdles and policy uncertainty also pose risks to the pace of renewable energy deployment.",
  "opportunities": "India's vast renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind energy, presents significant opportunities. Supportive government policies, increasing foreign investment, and technological advancements are key drivers for future growth. The country's focus on domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components further enhances its market attractiveness.",
  "future_outlook": "Looking ahead, India is expected to continue its robust growth in renewable energy capacity, aiming to meet its 2030 target. Continued policy support and investment in technology and infrastructure are critical for achieving these goals. The renewable energy sector in India is poised for significant expansion, offering promising opportunities for investors.",
