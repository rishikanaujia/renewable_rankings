  "overview": "The United States has historically been a leader in the deployment of renewable energy, with a significant increase in cumulative installed capacity over the years. This growth is indicative of a mature market with reduced regulatory risk, making it an attractive destination for renewable energy investment. The track record of renewable energy deployment in the United States is crucial for investors as it demonstrates market stability, technological adoption, and the potential for future growth.",
  "current_status": "As of the last available data in 2023, the United States had a substantial cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy, showcasing a robust track record. Key renewable energy sources contributing to this capacity include wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass. Recent developments have seen a surge in solar and wind installations, driven by technological advancements, policy support, and increased investment. The United States compares favorably to regional averages, particularly in wind and solar, indicating a leading position in renewable energy deployment in North America.",
  "historical_trends": "Over the past 3-5 years, the United States has seen a consistent growth in renewable energy capacity. This growth has been supported by significant policy initiatives, technological advancements, and a decrease in the cost of renewable technologies. Key turning points include the extension of tax credits for solar and wind projects and the announcement of ambitious renewable energy targets by several states.",
  "policy_framework": "The United States' renewable energy sector is supported by a mix of federal and state policies, including tax incentives, renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and grants for research and development. Recent policy announcements have focused on increasing the renewable energy target and investing in grid infrastructure to support the integration of renewable energy.",
