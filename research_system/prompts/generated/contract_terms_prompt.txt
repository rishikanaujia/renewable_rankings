You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Contract Terms
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Bankability, risk allocation, and PPA robustness. Evaluates standardization, enforceability, and investor-friendliness of renewable energy contracts.

Subcategory: Regulation
Level: 1

Typical Data Sources:
  - Sample PPAs and contracts
  - Legal framework assessments
  - International lender due diligence
  - Project finance transaction data


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Highly unfavorable terms, unenforceable contracts, severe investor risk
           Range: Non-bankable

Score 2: Major risk allocation issues, weak legal framework, difficult to finance
           Range: Very poor

Score 3: Significant concerns about enforceability and risk allocation
           Range: Poor

Score 4: Below-market terms, notable legal uncertainties
           Range: Below adequate

Score 5: Basic contract framework exists but with material weaknesses
           Range: Adequate

Score 6: Reasonable terms with some improvement needed
           Range: Above adequate

Score 7: Solid contract framework with minor gaps
           Range: Good

Score 8: Strong standardization, favorable risk allocation, highly bankable
           Range: Very good

Score 9: Internationally-competitive terms, proven track record
           Range: Excellent

Score 10: World-class contract framework, optimal risk allocation, maximum bankability
           Range: Best-in-class
