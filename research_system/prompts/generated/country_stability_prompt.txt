You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Country Stability
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Political and economic risk assessment based on Euromoney Country Risk (ECR) rating. Lower ECR = higher stability = higher score.

Subcategory: Regulation
Level: 1

Typical Data Sources:
  - Euromoney Country Risk (ECR)
  - World Bank Governance Indicators
  - Political Risk Services (PRS) Group


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 10: Extremely stable (minimal risk)
           Range: < 1.0

Score 9: Very stable (very low risk)
           Range: 1.0 – 1.99

Score 8: Stable (low risk)
           Range: 2.0 – 2.99

Score 7: Moderately stable (moderate risk)
           Range: 3.0 – 3.99

Score 6: Fair stability (elevated risk)
           Range: 4.0 – 4.99

Score 5: Moderate instability (significant risk)
           Range: 5.0 – 5.99

Score 4: Unstable (high risk)
           Range: 6.0 – 6.99

Score 3: Very unstable (very high risk)
           Range: 7.0 – 7.99

Score 2: Extremely unstable (severe risk)
           Range: 8.0 – 8.99

Score 1: Failed/fragile state (extreme risk)
           Range: ≥ 9.0
