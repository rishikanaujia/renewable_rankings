You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Energy Dependence
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Degree of reliance on energy imports. Lower import dependency indicates greater energy security and more favorable conditions for domestic renewable energy development.

Subcategory: Market_Size_Fundamentals
Level: 2

Typical Data Sources:
  - IEA World Energy Balances
  - BP Statistical Review of World Energy
  - National energy statistics


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 10: Energy independent (net exporter or minimal imports)
           Range: < 10%

Score 9: Very low dependence
           Range: 10% – 19%

Score 8: Low dependence
           Range: 20% – 29%

Score 7: Moderate-low dependence
           Range: 30% – 39%

Score 6: Moderate dependence
           Range: 40% – 49%

Score 5: Moderate-high dependence
           Range: 50% – 59%

Score 4: High dependence
           Range: 60% – 69%

Score 3: Very high dependence
           Range: 70% – 79%

Score 2: Extreme dependence
           Range: 80% – 89%

Score 1: Nearly total dependence (energy security risk)
           Range: ≥ 90%
