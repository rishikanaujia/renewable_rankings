You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Ownership Hurdles
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Regulatory and practical barriers to foreign ownership and market participation. Lower barriers enable greater international investment and competition.

Subcategory: Accommodation
Level: 1

Typical Data Sources:
  - OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index
  - World Bank Doing Business reports
  - National energy laws and regulations
  - Investment treaties and bilateral agreements


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Prohibitive barriers (foreign ownership banned or <10% allowed)
           Range: Severe restrictions

Score 2: Major restrictions (10-25% foreign ownership, complex approvals)
           Range: Very high barriers

Score 3: Significant restrictions (25-40% foreign ownership)
           Range: High barriers

Score 4: Notable restrictions (40-50% foreign ownership)
           Range: Above moderate barriers

Score 5: Some restrictions (50-65% foreign ownership)
           Range: Moderate barriers

Score 6: Limited restrictions (65-75% foreign ownership)
           Range: Below moderate barriers

Score 7: Minor restrictions (75-85% foreign ownership)
           Range: Low barriers

Score 8: Minimal restrictions (85-95% foreign ownership)
           Range: Very low barriers

Score 9: Nearly unrestricted (95-99% foreign ownership)
           Range: Minimal barriers

Score 10: Full market access (100% foreign ownership allowed)
           Range: No barriers
