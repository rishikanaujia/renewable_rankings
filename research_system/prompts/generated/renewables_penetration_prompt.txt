You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Renewables Penetration
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Current share of renewables in electricity generation. Higher penetration indicates market maturity, proven track record, and favorable conditions for further renewable development.

Subcategory: Market_Size_Fundamentals
Level: 2

Typical Data Sources:
  - IEA Electricity Information
  - IRENA Renewable Energy Statistics
  - Ember Climate - Global Electricity Review
  - National grid operators


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Minimal renewables (coal/gas/nuclear dominated)
           Range: < 5%

Score 2: Very low renewables penetration
           Range: 5% – 9%

Score 3: Low renewables penetration
           Range: 10% – 14%

Score 4: Below moderate penetration
           Range: 15% – 19%

Score 5: Moderate renewables penetration
           Range: 20% – 29%

Score 6: Above moderate penetration
           Range: 30% – 39%

Score 7: High renewables penetration
           Range: 40% – 49%

Score 8: Very high renewables penetration
           Range: 50% – 59%

Score 9: Outstanding renewables penetration
           Range: 60% – 74%

Score 10: World-leading renewables penetration (renewable-dominated grid)
           Range: ≥ 75%
