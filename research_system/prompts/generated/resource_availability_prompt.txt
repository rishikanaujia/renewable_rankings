You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Resource Availability
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Quality and abundance of solar and wind renewable energy resources. Combines solar irradiation (kWh/m²/day) and wind speed (m/s) to assess natural resource endowment.

Subcategory: Market_Size_Fundamentals
Level: 2

Typical Data Sources:
  - Global Solar Atlas (World Bank)
  - Global Wind Atlas (DTU)
  - NREL Renewable Energy Data


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Very poor resources (both solar and wind weak)
           Range: < 2.0

Score 2: Poor resources
           Range: 2.0 – 2.99

Score 3: Below average resources
           Range: 3.0 – 3.99

Score 4: Moderate resources
           Range: 4.0 – 4.99

Score 5: Average resources
           Range: 5.0 – 5.99

Score 6: Good resources
           Range: 6.0 – 6.99

Score 7: Very good resources
           Range: 7.0 – 7.99

Score 8: Excellent resources
           Range: 8.0 – 8.99

Score 9: Outstanding resources
           Range: 9.0 – 9.99

Score 10: World-class resources (exceptional solar and wind)
           Range: ≥ 10.0
