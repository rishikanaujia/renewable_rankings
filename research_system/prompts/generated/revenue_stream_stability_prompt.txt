You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Revenue Stream Stability
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Predictability and security of project revenues through PPA contracts. Longer contract terms with fixed prices provide greater revenue certainty and reduce merchant exposure risk.

Subcategory: Profitability
Level: 2

Typical Data Sources:
  - PPA databases and registries
  - Project finance documentation
  - Market PPA term benchmarks
  - Offtaker contract databases


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Minimal revenue security (merchant or very short-term)
           Range: < 3 years

Score 2: Very low stability (short-term contracts)
           Range: 3 – 4 years

Score 3: Low stability (below typical debt tenor)
           Range: 5 – 6 years

Score 4: Below moderate stability
           Range: 7 – 9 years

Score 5: Moderate stability (covers partial debt)
           Range: 10 – 11 years

Score 6: Above moderate stability
           Range: 12 – 14 years

Score 7: Good stability (covers typical debt tenor)
           Range: 15 – 17 years

Score 8: Very good stability
           Range: 18 – 19 years

Score 9: Outstanding stability (full project life)
           Range: 20 – 24 years

Score 10: Exceptional stability (ultra-long term contracts)
           Range: ≥ 25 years
