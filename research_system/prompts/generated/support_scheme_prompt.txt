You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Support Scheme
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Evaluation of current support mechanisms available and their efficacy

Subcategory: Regulation
Level: 1

Typical Data Sources:
  - Auction calendars
  - FiT schedules
  - Policy documents


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: No Support: No financial or regulatory support exists for renewable energy

Score 2: Emerging but Ineffective: No formal support, limited routes emerging organically

Score 3: Forces Into Disadvantage: Support exists but creates unhealthy competition

Score 4: Boom-Bust Support: Irregular and unstable, creating boom-bust cycles

Score 5: Under Threat: Mechanisms exist but face cancellation risk

Score 6: Federal-State Misalignment: Support present but policies conflict

Score 7: Solid but Uncertain: Well-established but nearing expiration

Score 8: Broad but Uneven: Multiple routes available but effectiveness varies

Score 9: Strong but Not Scalable: Clear and stable but not scalable enough

Score 10: Highly Mature: Long-term calendars, strong certainty, consistent investment
