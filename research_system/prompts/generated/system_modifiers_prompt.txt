You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: System Modifiers
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Composite adjustment factors including currency risk, geopolitical factors, and market anomalies. Acts as final calibration layer for overall rankings.

Subcategory: System_Modifiers
Level: 3

Typical Data Sources:
  - Currency volatility and exchange rate data
  - Geopolitical risk indices
  - Market anomaly detection
  - IMF and World Bank macroeconomic indicators


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Multiple severe risks compound to make market essentially uninvestable
           Range: Severe negative factors

Score 2: Major currency instability, severe geopolitical risks, or critical market failures
           Range: Very high negative impact

Score 3: Significant currency risk, high geopolitical uncertainty, or major market issues
           Range: High negative impact

Score 4: Notable currency volatility, elevated geopolitical concerns
           Range: Above moderate negative impact

Score 5: Balanced risk profile, manageable currency and geopolitical environment
           Range: Moderate factors

Score 6: Relatively stable currency, improving geopolitical environment
           Range: Below moderate positive impact

Score 7: Good currency stability, favorable geopolitical climate
           Range: Low risk environment

Score 8: Strong currency stability, very favorable conditions
           Range: Very low risk

Score 9: Excellent currency and geopolitical environment
           Range: Minimal risk

Score 10: Best-in-class stability across all system modifiers
           Range: Optimal conditions
