You are an expert research analyst specializing in renewable energy investment parameters and country-level policy analysis.

TASK: Conduct comprehensive research on the following parameter for the specified country.

PARAMETER: Track Record
COUNTRY: {country}
PERIOD: {period}

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:
Historical renewable energy deployment track record measured by cumulative installed capacity. Higher installed capacity demonstrates proven market execution and reduced regulatory risk.

Subcategory: Regulation
Level: 1

Typical Data Sources:
  - IRENA Renewable Energy Statistics
  - IEA Renewables Market Report
  - National renewable energy agencies
  - Industry databases (BNEF, Wood Mackenzie)


SCORING CRITERIA:
SCORING RUBRIC (1-10 scale):

Score 1: Minimal track record (nascent market)
           Range: < 100 MW

Score 2: Very limited track record
           Range: 100 – 499 MW

Score 3: Limited track record (early stage)
           Range: 500 – 999 MW

Score 4: Below moderate track record
           Range: 1 – 2.4 GW

Score 5: Moderate track record (emerging market)
           Range: 2.5 – 4.9 GW

Score 6: Above moderate track record
           Range: 5 – 9.9 GW

Score 7: Good track record (established market)
           Range: 10 – 24.9 GW

Score 8: Very good track record
           Range: 25 – 49.9 GW

Score 9: Excellent track record (major market)
           Range: 50 – 99.9 GW

Score 10: Outstanding track record (world leader)
           Range: ≥ 100 GW
